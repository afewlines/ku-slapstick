this folder is 4 source files. put the js in here, point the js to the build vue files


TO BUILD A VUE FILE it currently only partly works. will be much easier in next commit.

the file @/client/compileComponent takes the .vue as an argument and then spits out the minimized/compiled file in @/client/builtComponent. move it from there to @/server/game_modules to have it on the server

fuck.
