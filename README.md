### What is Slapstick?
SlapStick is a framework designed to serve games to a group of people in the same space. Taking cues from such games as _The Jackbox Party Pack_ and _Kahoot!_, the framework provides an interface to be presented to the group and per-player web interfaces for the players. Unlike those games, SlapStick allows for end-users to develop their own games for the framework using the SlapStick Game API. The API is designed to give perspective developers total creative freedom at the cost of slightly increased complexity, meaning that there are no theoretical bounds to the scope of designed games.
